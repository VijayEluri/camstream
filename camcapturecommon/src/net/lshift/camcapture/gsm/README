This is a copy of the LGPL GSM 06.10 codec library included in the
JDK_1_4_COMPATIBLE tag of Tritonus, from the CVS repository of the
Tritonus project on Sourceforge. See also http://www.tritonus.org/ and
http://kbs.cs.tu-berlin.de/~jutta/toast.html.

The reason we have a full copy of the source code here, rather than
using the precompiled Tritonus plugin jars, is that the "private"
keyword has once again been used by a library author in a way that I
need to change.

"private modifiers: Just Say No!"
